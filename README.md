# VotiZen

VotiZen is a mobile application that enables users to cast their votes without having to physically go to a polling booth. VotiZen can be used along with a tablet and fingerprint scanner in polling booths to make the voting process more secure, reliable, and transparent when compared to the existing EVM.

The application is built on Microsoft Azure and utilizes Blockchain as a service on Azure to ensure secure transactions.
